// Title: UVMC Connection Example - SC to SV, SC side
//
// This example shows a SC producer driving a SV consumer via a TLM connection
// made with UVMC, including how to derive a SC producer subtype that can
// control UVM phasing using the UVMC Command API.
// See <UVMC Connection Example - SC to SV, SV side> to see the SV portion
// of the example.
//
// (see UVMC_Connections_SC2SV.png)
//
// In a pure SC simulation, synchronization between a producer and consumer
// occurs exclusively through the protocol prescribed by the TLM standard.
// In mixed SC-SV simulation, SC usually elaborates and starts its threads
// before SV has finished elaborating. To prevent run-time errors, UVMC will
// block any cross-language access until SV is ready. This means calls to
// interface methods via SC ports or sockets connected to SV must be made
// from within SC threads (via the SC_THREAD macro or sc_spawn).
// 
// Blocking until SV is ready technically violates TLM non-blocking semantics.
// It was deemed more useful to hold back activity from all cross-language
// calls rather than reject all non-blocking calls until SV was ready. Future
// releases may provide an option to return immediately with 0 status from
// non-blocking calls.
//
// When a UVM testbench is sitting on the SV side, you must also consider UVM's
// phasing semantics, which says that a phase will end if there are no objections
// raised to its ending. When, as in this example, there is a SC-side participant
// to UVM phase control, an objection will need to be raised from the SC side
// for the phase(s) in which the SC side actively participates. The producer,
// in other words, must use the UVMC Command API to raise and drop the objection
// that corresponds to the phase in which it is generating stimulus. If it does
// not, then UVM (SV) will end that phase and likely end simulation before the
// SC producer has had a chance to emit the first transaction.
// 
// To preserve reuse, it is recommended that the UVM Command API usage be
// relegated to a subtype of the native SC producer. This way, you do not couple
// the producer's primary functionality (producing transactions) with
// cross-language synchronization issues and UVMC.

// Group: UVM-aware SC producer
//
// This example defines the ~producer_uvm~ class, which derives from
// our generic SC ~producer~. In it, we spawn a dynamic ~objector~ thread
// that calls ~uvmc_raise_objection~ to UVM's run phase. This keeps simulation
// alive on the SV side while the base ~producer~ in SC generates stimulus.
//
// When the base ~producer~ is finished generating stimulus, it will notify a
// ~done~ sc_event. The ~objector~ thread in this ~producer_uvm~ wakes up on
// that event notification and drops its objection using ~uvmc_drop_objection~.
// This allows UVM simulation to proceed to the next phase and eventually
// complete simulation.

//
// The ~sc_main~ function below creates and starts the SC portion of this example.
// It does the following:
//
// - Instantiates a basic ~producer~
//
// - Registers the producer's ~in~ port with UVMC using the lookup
//   string "42". During elaboration, UVMC will connect this port with
//   a port registered with the same lookup string. In this example, the
//   match will occur with a consumer's ~in~ port on the SV side.
//
// - Calls ~sc_start~ to start SystemC
