Title: UVM Command Examples

The ~examples/commands~ directory contains several examples of using the
UVMC Command API from SystemC to query, configure, and control UVM simulation
in SystemVerilog.

See <Getting Started> for setup requirements before running the examples.
Specifically, you will need to have precompiled the UVM and UVMC
libraries and set environment variables pointing to them.

Use ~make help~ to view the menu of available examples:

|> make help

You'll get a menu similar to the following

| |   config    : shows usage of the UVMC set/get config API        |
| |                                                                 |

| |                                                                 |
| |   topology  : illusrates how (and when) to dump UVM topology    |
| |                                                                 |
| |   phasing   : show how SC can wait for any UVM phase state      |
| |               and raise/drop objections to control their        |
| |               progression                                       |

| | UVM_HOME and UVMC_HOME specify the location of the source       |
| | headers and macro definitions needed by the examples. You must  |
| | specify their locations via UVM_HOME and UVMC_HOME environment  |
| | variables or make command line options. Command line options    |
| | override any envrionment variable settings.                     |
| |                                                                 |
| | The UVM and UVMC libraries must be compiled prior to running    |
| | any example. If the libraries are not at their default location |
| | (UVMC_HOME/lib) then you must specify their location via the    |
| | UVM_LIB and/or UVMC_LIB environment variables or make command   |
| | line options. Make command line options take precedence.        |
| |                                                                 |
| | If TRACE=1 is used, UVM command tracing is enabled (try it!)    |
| |                                                                 |
| | Other options:                                                  |
| |                                                                 |
| |   all   : Run all examples                                      |
| |   clean : Remove simulation files and directories               |
| |   help  : Print this help information                           |
| |                                                                 |

To run just the 'phasing' example

  | > make phasing

This runs the 'phasing' example with the UVM source location defined by
the ~UVM_HOME~ environment variable and the UVM and UVMC compiled
libraries at their default location, ~../../lib/uvmc_lib~.

To run all ~UVM Command~ examples

  | prompt> make all

The ~clean~ target deletes all the simulation files produced from previous
runs.

  | prompt> make clean

You can combine targets in one command line

  | prompt> make clean all

The following runs the 'phasing' example using the UVM library at the given
path, which overrides the UVM_HOME environment variable.

  | > make UVM_HOME=<path> phasing


Assuming your environment is properly set up, choose an example to
run from the menu, say

|> make phasing

This compiles and runs the example that demonstrates SC waiting for
and controlling phase progression in SV UVM.
